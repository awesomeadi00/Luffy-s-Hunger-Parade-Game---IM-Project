This is a basic platform game I made which is about a show called "One Piece". The idea behind the game is you control the main character called "Luffy". and he will have a constant depleting hunger bar. Random food items will continuously spawn so keep eating foods to fill that up. Keep jumping around and eat a bunch of foods as possible to get the highest score before his hunger bar depletes!

You can change the difficulty setting at the home screen. The harder it is, the faster Luffy's hunger bar depletes. Enjoy!
