# Luffys Hunger Parade Game - IM Project
# Disclaimer: This game only works as a p5js project!

This is a basic platform game I made for my class Intro to Interactive Media which is about a show called "One Piece". The idea you control the main character called "Luffy". and he will have a depleting hunger bar. Random food items will continuously spawn so keep eating foods to fill that up. Keep jumping around and eat a bunch of foods as possible to get the highest score before his hunger bar depletes!
